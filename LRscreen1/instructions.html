<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Lipreading Screening Test</h1>

<p>In this test, you will lipread a set of unrelated sentences. The sentences are Standard English. Your task is to type into the computer what the man or woman said.
</p>
<strong>How many sentences will there be?</strong> There will be 17 spoken by a man and 17 spoken by a woman.<br><br>

<strong>How many times will each sentence appear?</strong> Once only.<br><br>

<strong>How long do I have to type in my response?</strong> Take the time you need.<br><br>

<strong>Should I guess?</strong> Please watch the video carefully, and type whatever you think the man or woman said. If you only understood a few words or parts of words, just type them in the order you saw them. If you are uncertain, give your estimate. Even part of a word is okay.<br><br> 

<strong>How about spelling and punctuation?</strong> Use Standard English spelling.  Don’t use casual spellings such as “n-i-t-e” for “night.” Use contractions such as “I’ll” if that’s what was said. Otherwise type “I will.” You don’t need to use capital letters or punctuation such as question mark, comma or period. Don’t use extra spaces, dots, or dashes.<br><br>

<strong>Can I change my answer?</strong> You can make changes by using the backspace. But after you hit ENTER, you cannot return to that sentence.<br><br>

After each sentence, hitting ENTER will take you to the next sentence. Please push ENTER when you are ready to see the first sentence.<br><br>
